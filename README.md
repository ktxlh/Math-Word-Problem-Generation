# Math Word Problem Generation
Math word problem generation with HSMM neural templates, BERT, and GAN


## Roadmap
- [x] Neural-template-based: HSMM+LSTM model
- [x] Language-model-based: BERT finetuned on MWP datasets
- [x] GAN with two BERTs
- [x] Analyze what causes the advantages and disadvantages of our previous  methods
- [ ] Architect a new model that incoporate the analyzed advantages of the above models
- [ ] Evaluate the new model
